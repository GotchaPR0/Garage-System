# Garage-System
The Garage system was built using Java programming language. Our team followed the software engineering life cycle, SOLID principles, and Design Patterns.
Garage System has slots for every parking vehicle by assigning IDs for the parking slots and supports two different parking approaches:
- First In First Served Approach
- Best Fit Approach
